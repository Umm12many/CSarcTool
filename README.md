# CSarcTool
This is Sarc-Tool ported to C# with a GUI.

# Installation
## Windows
Simply download the zip from releases and run the exe inside, then you can do whatever you are going to do with szs, sarc, and other sarc file format extraction/compression.
## Linux & MacOS(No idea if MacOS will work btw)
Build it yourself by cloning the repo and downloading .NET 10 and running:
```bash
dotnet publish --sc true -c Release -f net10.0-desktop
```
in the project directory

# Usage
Once the application is opened, it is pretty self explanitory on how to use.
